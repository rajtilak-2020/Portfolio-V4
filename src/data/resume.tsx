    summary: "I‚Äôm a developer from **India** exploring the ever-evolving world of tech from creative design systems and frontend wizardry to the depths of **cybersecurity** and **IoT**. I‚Äôm passionate about crafting smooth, meaningful **digital experiences** that are both functional and fun. Whether it's building intuitive web interfaces, experimenting with microcontrollers, or diving into open-source tools, I love turning ideas into real-world applications. Tech excites me because there's always something new to create, break, or improve. I‚Äôm also an active contributor on GitHub, constantly experimenting and learning in public. When I‚Äôm not coding, you‚Äôll probably find me exploring design trends, tinkering with robotics, or sipping coffee while refining a UI interaction. Check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/rajtilak-2020) to see what I‚Äôve been building, or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/krajtilak2020) for collabs, insights, and occasional tech rants!",
