## Leading a Robotics Workshop and Innovating with IoT

I had the honor of serving as the **team lead** for a **three-day robotics workshop** at our college, where we successfully built an **IoT-controlled outdoor surveillance robot**. This experience was an incredible opportunity to guide my peers through the dynamic field of **robotics and IoT**.

Under the mentorship of the **Institutionâ€™s Innovation Council** and the **Robotics Club**, we explored cutting-edge technologies, developed hands-on solutions, and implemented real-world applications. It was a rewarding experience to see our collaborative efforts materialize into a functional and innovative project.

I extend my sincere gratitude to my mentors and teammates for their dedication and enthusiasm. Looking forward to more opportunities to explore, learn, and lead in the field of technology.
