Presenting my research paper at [**ISAC3-2025**](https://isac3.in) wasn’t just a conference highlight—it was a personal milestone that reshaped how I see myself as a student, creator, and future researcher.

As a diploma student in Computer Science & Engineering, entering a space where ideas are dissected, debated, and celebrated was both nerve-racking and transformative. My paper, titled **“Real-Time Servo Motor Control Over Wi-Fi Using ESP32 and WebSocket”** (Paper ID: **1017**), was accepted for oral presentation—an opportunity that would become a defining moment in my academic life.

## How It All Started: An Idea Born from Curiosity

It began with a simple question: *"Can we control a robotic arm in real time over Wi-Fi without using any cloud service?"*

That question evolved into weeks of prototyping, debugging, and late-night coding sessions. I used the ESP32 microcontroller, WebSockets, and servo motors to build a web-controlled robotic arm with a fully offline interface.

The prototype shown here demonstrates the physical implementation of the system. The robotic arm was designed to be controlled through a web interface, allowing for real-time manipulation of servo motors over a Wi-Fi connection.

But what started as a project for my final-year group work turned into something much more—a chance to dive into the research world and contribute something meaningful to the academic community.

## [ISAC3-2025](https://isac3.in): My First Academic Conference

Held on **July 25, 2025**, [ISAC3](https://isac3.in) brought together researchers, engineers, and students from across the country—and even international scholars—from fields like IoT, AI, cyber security, and embedded systems. The venue buzzed with energy, filled with conversations about innovation, future trends, and fresh ideas.

For someone attending a research conference for the first time, it was overwhelming—but also thrilling.

## Pre-Presentation Anxiety and an Unexpected Moment of Mentorship

Minutes before my scheduled presentation, I was sitting quietly, mentally rehearsing my slides, feeling a wave of nervousness I couldn’t shake.

That’s when I met [**Prof. Gyoo-Soo Chae**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=FfJ6EwUAAAAJ&hl=ko) from South Korea—a globally respected expert in Smart IT Engineering and RF systems. Sensing my anxiety, he offered a few words that changed everything:

> *“Speak from conviction, not just slides. Share what you built, not just what you wrote.”*

Those few minutes of calm, personal mentorship helped me regain focus. It wasn’t about impressing people—it was about sharing something I worked hard on. That moment grounded me, and I’ll carry his advice into every future presentation.

## My Research Paper: A Glimpse into the Technicals

My paper explored how real-time servo motor control can be achieved over a Wi-Fi interface using:

![Technical Architecture - right medium](/architecturediagramisac3.webp)

- **ESP32 as a standalone access point**
- **WebSocket communication for low-latency control**
- **A custom web UI with sliders and real-time servo feedback**
- **Offline operation without reliance on cloud or external networks**

The system even featured **recording and playback of servo sequences**, simulating real-world use cases like pick-and-place automation.

The technical architecture diagram shows the flow of data from the web interface through the ESP32 to the servo motors, demonstrating the complete system integration.

I received thoughtful feedback from professors and industry attendees—some curious about scaling the system, others interested in its applications in low-cost robotics and smart labs.

## What I Learned Beyond the Paper

Beyond the technical insights, [ISAC3](https://isac3.in) taught me skills that go far beyond engineering:

- **Public Speaking:** I learned to simplify and confidently explain my work.
- **Networking:** I met people from various domains—some students like me, others industry veterans.
- **Mentorship Matters:** A small word of encouragement from the right person can shift your entire mindset.
- **Research Culture:** I got a firsthand look at how research is not about perfection—it’s about curiosity, experimentation, and persistence.

## Final Thoughts: From Student to Researcher

Walking out of that presentation room, I wasn’t the same person who walked in. I felt lighter, more inspired, and more certain about one thing—this is just the beginning.

I may still be a student, but [ISAC3](https://isac3.in) gave me my first glimpse of what it feels like to be a **researcher**—someone who contributes, asks questions, and stands on a stage not to prove, but to share.

If you're a student wondering whether to submit your project to a conference, let this be your sign: *Do it—even if you feel nervous, even if you think you're not ready.* The growth that comes from trying is worth it.

**Here's to more papers, more courage, and more ideas worth sharing.**
