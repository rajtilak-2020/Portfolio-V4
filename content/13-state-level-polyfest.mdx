## At BOSE College, Cuttack

On March 3, 2025, I had the privilege of representing **DRIEMS Polytechnic** alongside my talented team at the **State Level Polyfest 2025**, held at **BOSE College, Cuttack, Odisha**. This annual event brought together some of the brightest minds from polytechnic colleges across the state, and it was an incredible opportunity to showcase our **Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) robot project** in the **Scale Model Competition**. Competing as representatives of the **Cuttack region**, we stood shoulder-to-shoulder with numerous teams from all corners of Odisha, each bringing their own innovative ideas to the table. This experience was not just a competition—it was a celebration of creativity, teamwork, and technological advancement.

### The Journey to Polyfest 2025

Our journey to Polyfest began months ago in the labs and workshops of DRIEMS Polytechnic. As a team, we were driven by a shared passion for robotics and a desire to create something impactful. After brainstorming and countless hours of planning, we decided to develop a **UGV robot**—a scale model designed to demonstrate the potential of unmanned systems in real-world applications. From logistics to disaster management, UGVs are transforming industries, and we wanted our project to reflect that potential.
The process wasn’t easy. We spent late nights sketching designs, sourcing materials, and fine-tuning the mechanics of our model. There were moments of frustration—like when a circuit failed just hours before a test run—but those challenges only strengthened our resolve. With guidance from our faculty at DRIEMS Polytechnic and a lot of trial and error, we finally had a working prototype ready to compete on a state-level stage.

### Arriving at BOSE College, Cuttack

Walking into BOSE College on the day of Polyfest felt surreal. The campus buzzed with energy as teams from across Odisha set up their projects, exchanged ideas, and prepared for the competition. The Scale Model Competition was one of the highlights of the event, attracting a diverse range of entries—from renewable energy models to advanced robotics. As representatives of the Cuttack region, we felt a mix of pride and pressure to perform well and make our college proud.
Our team set up our UGV robot at the designated booth, and it quickly drew attention. The sleek design, coupled with its functional capabilities, sparked curiosity among fellow participants and judges alike. We were ready to demonstrate what our little machine could do.

### Presenting the UGV Robot Project

The core of our project was a **scale-model UGV** designed for autonomous navigation and obstacle avoidance. Equipped with sensors and a lightweight chassis, it could maneuver through a predefined course while avoiding obstacles—a simplified yet practical demonstration of how UGVs operate in real-world scenarios. We chose this concept because it aligns with emerging trends in automation and robotics, fields that are increasingly relevant in today’s tech-driven world.
During the presentation, we explained the technical aspects to the judges: the use of ultrasonic sensors for obstacle detection, the programming logic behind its autonomy, and the potential applications of such a system. We also highlighted the teamwork and problem-solving skills that went into building it. One of the standout moments was the live demo—watching our UGV glide smoothly across the test track, dodging obstacles with precision, was incredibly satisfying. The crowd’s applause and the judges’ nods of approval made all our hard work feel worth it.

### Competing Against the Best in Odisha

The competition was fierce. With so many colleges participating from across the state, we saw an impressive array of projects. Some teams showcased solar-powered devices, while others presented intricate mechanical systems. What struck me most was the sheer diversity of talent and innovation on display. Polyfest wasn’t just about winning—it was about learning from others and pushing the boundaries of what we thought was possible.
Our team faced tough questions from the judges about scalability, cost-efficiency, and practical implementation. These weren’t just technical queries; they forced us to think critically about the real-world impact of our project. While we didn’t have all the answers, the feedback we received was invaluable and gave us ideas for future improvements.

### Key Takeaways from Polyfest 2025

Participating in Polyfest 2025 left us with several key takeaways:

- **Teamwork Makes the Dream Work**: Building and presenting the UGV was a collective effort. Every team member brought something unique to the table—whether it was coding, hardware expertise, or presentation skills.
- **Practical Exposure**: Competitions like these bridge the gap between classroom theory and real-world application. We learned more in those few days than we could have from weeks of lectures.
- **Innovation is Everywhere**: Seeing the projects from other colleges inspired us to think bigger and explore new ideas for our next venture.
- **Representing Cuttack**: It was an honor to represent our region and DRIEMS Polytechnic. The experience reinforced the importance of regional pride and collaboration.

### Reflections and Gratitude

Looking back, Polyfest 2025 was more than just a competition—it was a milestone in our journey as budding engineers and innovators. Standing on that stage, presenting our UGV robot, I felt a sense of accomplishment that went beyond the event itself. It was a reminder of why I chose this field: to create, to solve problems, and to contribute to a future shaped by technology.
A heartfelt thank you goes to **DRIEMS Polytechnic** for giving us this platform and supporting us every step of the way. Our faculty’s encouragement and the resources provided by our college were instrumental in getting us to Polyfest. I’d also like to thank **BOSE College, Cuttack**, for hosting such a well-organized event, and the judges for their insightful feedback. And, of course, a huge shoutout to my team—none of this would have been possible without their dedication and enthusiasm.

### Looking Ahead

Polyfest 2025 has lit a spark in us. We’re already brainstorming ways to improve our UGV—maybe adding remote control features or enhancing its AI capabilities. The experience has motivated us to participate in more events, refine our skills, and continue exploring the world of robotics and automation.
For anyone reading this who’s considering a career in technology or engineering, I’d say: take every opportunity to step out of the classroom and test your ideas in the real world. Events like Polyfest are the perfect place to start.
Here’s to more innovations, more competitions, and more unforgettable experiences!
