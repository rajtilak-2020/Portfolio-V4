## Real-World Learning and Passion Projects

From designing embedded systems to developing web apps, I sought out every chance to turn classroom theory into functional prototypes.

### ü¶æ Real-Time Robotic Arm Using ESP32

One of my favorite achievements was developing a **robotic arm** controlled entirely over Wi-Fi using the **ESP32 microcontroller and WebSockets**. I built a custom web interface that allowed users to adjust servo motors in real-time, without relying on cloud services. This project taught me the importance of real-time systems, synchronization, and frontend-backend integration.

It also became the cornerstone of my **final-year group project** and eventually led to my first research paper, which I presented at [ISAC3-2025](https://isac3.in).

### üõ†Ô∏è Internship Experience at Alpha EV

Interning at **Alpha EV** was a hands-on crash course in industrial IoT and smart devices. I was trusted with tasks that challenged me every day:

- **Assembling and testing IoT vending machines**, where I worked on circuit connectivity, Wi-Fi modules, and interface calibration.
- **Building a mobile surveillance rover** equipped with remote video streaming and movement control.
- Conducting **power and cost optimization analysis** for EV charging stations, learning how software meets hardware in sustainable tech.

This internship not only deepened my technical skill set but also exposed me to real-world team dynamics, quality control processes, and client-ready deployments.

## Beyond the Classroom: Events, Hosting & Hackathons

Outside the lab, I made it a point to involve myself in tech communities, events, and competitions.

Whether it was hosting a seminar, organizing a coding challenge, or presenting in front of faculty and students, I used these moments to refine my **communication skills** and **leadership presence**.

I also represented my institution at **state-level expos** and **inter-college hackathons**, where the goal was to turn a concept into a prototype in under 24 hours.

These fast-paced events tested both my problem-solving skills and my ability to collaborate effectively under pressure. The thrill of solving a tough challenge with a team is unmatched‚Äîand it‚Äôs where I truly began to see myself as an engineer, not just a student.

## Personal Growth Through the Journey

The past three years have taught me much more than syntax and circuits:

- I‚Äôve learned **how to debug problems when there‚Äôs no StackOverflow answer.**
- I‚Äôve discovered that sometimes the best ideas come at **2AM with a cold coffee and a notebook.**
- I‚Äôve built resilience, patience, and a mindset of **continuous iteration**‚Äîknowing the first version is never the final one.

Most importantly, I‚Äôve learned how to learn‚Äîan essential trait in a field that evolves as fast as technology does.

## Gratitude and Forward Vision

I‚Äôm deeply thankful to **DRIEMS Polytechnic**‚Äîto the faculty who challenged me, to lab mentors who guided me, and to friends who collaborated, competed, and supported me through every semester.

This diploma is not an end‚Äîit's the **foundation** of everything that lies ahead.

I'm now continuing my journey with a focus on:

- üåê **Full Stack Web Development**  
- üì° **IoT and Embedded Systems**  
- üß† **Applied Technology for Real-World Use Cases**  

With every new project, I aim to push boundaries, build things that matter, and keep sharing what I learn along the way.

## Final Thoughts

There‚Äôs a certain joy in looking back and realizing how far you‚Äôve come. From wiring up my first LED to presenting at a national research conference, every step has shaped the developer I‚Äôm becoming.

If you‚Äôre a student reading this, unsure whether you're ready to build something or apply for that hackathon‚Äî**do it anyway**. *"Growth doesn‚Äôt come from being ready. It comes from **taking the leap**."*

**Here‚Äôs to more circuits, more code, more coffee-fueled nights, and more ideas worth building.**
