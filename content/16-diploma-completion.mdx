I’m pleased to share the successful completion of a significant milestone in my academic journey — my **Diploma in Computer Science & Engineering** from **DRIEMS Polytechnic**, under the aegis of **SCTE&VT Odisha**, with a final **CGPA of 8.20**, earning me a **Distinction**.

This chapter has been both rigorous and rewarding, offering far more than what’s taught in books. It has been a time of **intellectual growth, technical exploration, and personal transformation**. Over the span of three years, I have evolved not only as a student but as a technology enthusiast ready to embrace complexity and innovation.

## Building Real-World Skills

Throughout my diploma, I engaged in several hands-on projects and industry-relevant activities that helped bridge theory with practical application. Some notable experiences include:

-🦾 **Designing and developing a real-time robotic arm** controlled over Wi-Fi using **ESP32 and WebSockets**, combining embedded systems with responsive web interfaces.
 
-🛠️ An enriching internship at **Alpha EV**, where I contributed to:

 - Assembling and testing **IoT-enabled vending machines** and a **mobile surveillance rover**.
 
 - Performing **energy and cost analysis** for EV charging infrastructure.
 
 - Gaining exposure to real-world practices in **robotics and industrial IoT**.

-💡 Participating in multiple tech events and workshops that honed both my **presentation skills** and **collaborative problem-solving abilities**.

These experiences fostered a mindset of innovation and resilience—qualities that I believe are essential in today’s rapidly evolving tech landscape.

## A Vision for the Future: Cyber Security & Cyber Defence

With a solid foundation in core computing principles and real-time systems, I am now ready to take the next leap — pursuing a **B.Tech in Cyber Security and Cyber Defence**.

In an era where digital threats loom large, the need for skilled professionals who can **secure systems, detect vulnerabilities, and defend infrastructure** is more critical than ever. This upcoming academic chapter will allow me to delve into:

- 🔐 **Ethical hacking and penetration testing**
- 🔍 **Digital forensics and incident response**
- 🌐 **Network and infrastructure security**
- 🧠 **Cyber intelligence and risk mitigation strategies**

My diploma journey has shaped my interest in these areas, and I’m looking forward to applying both my hardware background and software skills to explore the multidimensional world of cybersecurity.

## Gratitude and Forward Momentum

I owe immense gratitude to **DRIEMS Polytechnic** for nurturing my growth, to my mentors for their guidance, and to my peers and family for their constant encouragement. This achievement is not an endpoint but a stepping stone.

As I step into the world of cyber defence, my goal is clear — to become a responsible, skilled, and adaptive technologist capable of contributing meaningfully to digital safety and technological advancement.

The journey continues, and I’m more driven than ever.
